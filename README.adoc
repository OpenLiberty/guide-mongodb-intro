Learn how to persist data in your microservices to MongoDB, a document-oriented NoSQL database.

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to use MongoDB to build and test a simple microservice that manages the members of a crew. The microservice will respond to `POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests that manipulate the database.

The crew members will be stored in MongoDB as documents in the following JSON format:

[source,json,role="no_copy"]
----
{
  "_id": {
    "$oid": "5dee6b079503234323db2ebc"
  },
  "Name": "Member1",
  "Rank": "Captain",
  "CrewID": "000001"
}
----

This microservice connects to MongoDB by using Transport Layer Security (TLS) and injects a `MongoDatabase` instance into the service with a Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI) producer. Additionally, MicroProfile Config is used to easily configure the MongoDB driver.

For more information about CDI and MicroProfile Config, see the guides on https://openliberty.io/guides/cdi-intro.html[Injecting dependencies into microservices^] and https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-config-intro.html[Separating configuration from code in microservices^].

// =================================================================================================
// Additional Prerequisites
// =================================================================================================

== Additional prerequisites

You will use Docker to run an instance of MongoDB for a fast installation and setup. Install Docker by following the instructions in the official https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation[Docker documentation^], and start your Docker environment.

=== Setting up MongoDB

This guide uses Docker to run an instance of MongoDB. A multi-stage Dockerfile is provided for you. This Dockerfile uses the `mongo` image as the base image of the final stage and gathers the required configuration files. The resulting `mongo` image runs in a Docker container, and you must set up a new database for the microservice. Lastly, the truststore that's generated in the Docker image is copied from the container and placed into the Open Liberty server.

You can find more details and configuration options on the https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/[MongoDB website^]. For more information about the `mongo` image, see https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo[mongo^] in Docker Hub.

**Running MongoDB in a Docker container**

Run the following commands to use the Dockerfile to build the image, run the image in a Docker container, and map port `27017` from the container to your host machine:

[role='command']
```
docker build -t mongo-sample -f assets/Dockerfile .
docker run --name mongo-guide -p 27017:27017 -d mongo-sample
```

**Adding the truststore to the Open Liberty server**

The truststore that's created in the container needs to be added to the Open Liberty server so that the server can trust the certificate that MongoDB presents when they connect. Run the following command to copy the `truststore.p12` file from the container to the `start` and `finish` directories:

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]

The values from the [hotspot file=1]`microprofile-config.properties` file are injected into the [hotspot=mongoProducerInjections file=0]`MongoProducer` class. The `MongoProducer` class requires the following methods for the `MongoClient`:

* The [hotspot=createMongo file=0]`createMongo()` producer method returns an instance of `MongoClient`. In this method, the username, database name, and decoded password are passed into the [hotspot=createCredential file=0]`MongoCredential.createCredential()` method to get an instance of `MongoCredential`. The [hotspot=sslContext file=0]`JSSEHelper` gets the `SSLContext` from the `outboundSSLContext` in the `server.xml` file. Then, a [hotspot=mongoClient file=0]`MongoClient` instance is created.

* The [hotspot=createDB file=0]`createDB()` producer method returns an instance of `MongoDatabase` that depends on the `MongoClient`. This method injects the `MongoClient` in its parameters and passes the database name into the [hotspot=getDatabase file=0]`MongoClient.getDatabase()` method to get a `MongoDatabase` instance.

* The [hotspot=close file=0]`close()` method is a clean-up function for the `MongoClient` that closes the connection to the `MongoDatabase` instance.

// =================================================================================================

== Implementing the Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete operations

You are going to implement the basic create, retrieve, update, and delete (CRUD) operations in the `CrewService` class. The [hotspot=mongoImports1]`com.mongodb.client` and [hotspot=mongoImports2]`com.mongodb.client.result` packages are used to help implement these operations for the microservice. For more information about these packages, see the https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.12/javadoc/com/mongodb/client/package-summary.html[com.mongodb.client^] and https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.12/javadoc/com/mongodb/client/result/package-summary.html[com.mongodb.client.result^] Javadoc. For more information about creating a RESTful service with JAX-RS, JSON-B, and Open Liberty, see the guide on https://openliberty.io/guides/rest-intro.html[Creating a RESTful web serivce^].

[source, Java, linenums, role="code_column hide_tags=copyright"]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/application/CrewMember.java[]
----

In this class, a [hotspot=beanValidator]`Validator` is used to validate a [hotspot=crewMember file=1]`CrewMember` before the database is updated. The CDI producer is used to inject a [hotspot=dbInjection]`MongoDatabase` into the CrewService class.


**Implementing the Create operation**

The [hotspot=add]`add()` method handles the implementation of the create operation. An instance of `MongoCollection` is retrieved with the [hotspot=getCollection]`MongoDatabase.getCollection()` method. The `Document` type parameter specifies that the `Document` type is used to store data in the `MongoCollection`. Each crew member is converted into a [hotspot=crewMemberCreation]`Document`, and the [hotspot=insertOne]`MongoCollection.insertOne()` method inserts a new crew member document.


**Implementing the Retrieve operation**

The [hotspot=retrieve]`retrieve()` method handles the implementation of the retrieve operation. The `Crew` collection is retrieved with the [hotspot=getCollectionRead]`MongoDatabase.getCollection()` method. Then, the [hotspot=find]`MongoCollection.find()` method retrieves a `FindIterable` object. This object is iterable for all the crew members documents in the collection, so each crew member document is concatenated into a String array and returned.


**Implementing the Update operation**

The [hotspot=update]`update()` method handles the implementation of the update operation. After the `Crew` collection is retrieved, a document is created with the specified object `id` and is used to query the collection. Next, a new crew member [hotspot=crewMemberUpdate]`Document` is created with the updated configuration. The [hotspot=replaceOne]`MongoCollection.replaceOne()` method is called with the query and new crew member document. This method updates all of the matching queries with the new document. Because the object `id` is unique in the `Crew` collection, only one document is updated. The `MongoCollection.replaceOne()` method also returns an `UpdateResult` instance, which determines how many documents matched the query. If there are zero matches, then the object `id` doesn't exist.


**Implementing the Delete operation**

The [hotspot=remove]`remove()` method handles the implementation of the delete operation. After the `Crew` collection is retrieved, a [hotspot=queryDelete]`Document` is created with the specified object `id` and is used to query the collection. Because the object `id` is unique in the `Crew` collection, only one document is deleted. After the document is deleted, the [hotspot=deleteOne]`MongoCollection.deleteOne()` method returns a `DeleteResult` instance, which determines how many documents were deleted. If zero documents were deleted, then the object `id` doesn't exist.

// =================================================================================================

== Configuring the MongoDB driver and the server

MicroProfile Config makes configuring the MongoDB driver simple because all of the configuration can be set in one place and injected into the CDI producer.

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the configuration file.#
`src/main/webapp/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties`
----

microprofile-config.properties
[source, properties, linenums, role="code_column hide_tags=copyright"]
----
include::finish/src/main/webapp/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties[]
----

Values such as the hostname, port, and database name for the running MongoDB instance are set in this file. The user’s username and password are also set here. For added security, the password was encoded by using the https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/command/securityUtility-encode.html[securityUtility encode command^].

To create a CDI producer for MongoDB and connect over TLS, the Open Liberty server needs to be correctly configured.

[role="code_command hotspot file=1", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the server configuration file.#
`src/main/liberty/config/server.xml`
----

server.xml
[source,xml,linenums,role="code_column hide_tags=copyright"]
----
include::finish/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml[]
----

The features that are required to create the CDI producer for MongoDB are https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/feature/cdi-4.0.html[Contexts and Dependency Injection^] (`cdi-4.0`), https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/feature/ssl-1.0.html[Secure Socket Layer^] (`ssl-1.0`), https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/feature/mpConfig-3.0.html[MicroProfile Config^] (`mpConfig-3.0`), and https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/feature/passwordUtilities-1.1.html[Password Utilities^] (`passwordUtilities-1.1`). These features are specified in the [hotspot=featureManager file=1]`featureManager` element. The Secure Socket Layer (SSL) context is configured in the `server.xml` file so that the application can connect to MongoDB with TLS. The [hotspot=keyStore file=1]`keyStore` element points to the `truststore.p12` keystore file that was created in one of the previous sections. The [hotspot=ssl file=1]`ssl` element specifies the `defaultKeyStore` as the keystore and `outboundTrustStore` as the truststore.

After you replace the `server.xml` file, the Open Liberty configuration is automatically reloaded.
